# Logan Laszewski

### Introduction

My name is Logan Laszewski, and I recently graduated from Elon University with a double major in Data Analytics and Applied Mathematics. I’m passionate about using data to uncover insights and solve real-world problems that drive meaningful decision-making.

What sets me apart is my ability to approach challenges from both analytical and abstract perspectives, backed by a strong foundation in mathematics and statistics. Through coursework, internships, and a consulting project with Labcorp, I’ve developed key skills in data cleaning, visualization, and dashboard development. My work with the nonprofit HWH expanded my knowledge of machine learning, including building and deploying both linear and non linear models.

This blend of technical ability and hands-on experience fuels my drive to keep learning and growing in the field of data analytics and data science.
